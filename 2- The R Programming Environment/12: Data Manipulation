| I just opened an R script for you, and I have loaded a dataset called `worldcup`. For this question, you will be adding a function from `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the
| pipe chain in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to submit your script, save the
| script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original state.

> ?tidyr
> dplyr(wc_1)
Error in dplyr(wc_1) : could not find function "dplyr"
> submit()

| Sourcing your script...

Error in tidyr(., wc_1) : could not find function "tidyr"

| Not quite! Try again.

| Check the example output in the comments of the script I opened for you. Make sure you are selecting just the four columns shown in this example output. Try
| running your code in the console and printing out the result to determine whether it's successfully generating the desired final data frame before you submit it.

| In this question, you will continue to build on the data cleaning you started in the last question. I opened a new R script for you with the previous question
| completed. As a next step, you now need to reduce the data frame to show the mean of each column selected in the previous step. To do this, add a function from
| `dplyr` or `tidyr` to the pipe chain in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown in the comments of the script. When you are ready to
| submit your script, save the script and type `submit()`, or type `reset()` to reset the script to its original state.
