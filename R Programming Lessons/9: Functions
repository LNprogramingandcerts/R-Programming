| Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the R language. They are small pieces of reusable code that can be treated like any other R object.

| If you've worked through any other part of this course, you've probably used some functions already. Functions are usually characterized by the name of the
| function followed by parentheses.

| Let's try using a few basic functions just for fun. The Sys.Date() function returns a string representing today's date. Type Sys.Date() below and see what
| happens.

> 
> Sys.Date(\)
Error: unexpected input in "Sys.Date(\"
> Sys.Date()
[1] "2018-06-02"

| You got it right!

| Most functions in R return a value. Functions like Sys.Date() return a value based on your computer's environment, while other functions manipulate input data in
| order to compute a return value.

| The mean() function takes a vector of numbers as input, and returns the average of all of the numbers in the input vector. Inputs to functions are often called
| arguments. Providing arguments to a function is also sometimes called passing arguments to that function. Arguments you want to pass to a function go inside the
| function's parentheses. Try passing the argument c(2, 4, 5) to the mean() function.

> mean(c(2,4,5))
[1] 3.666667

| You got it!

  |================                                                                                                                                          |  10%
| Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates on. For example, the mean() function takes a vector as an argument, like in the
| case of mean(c(2,6,8)). The mean() function then adds up all of the numbers in the vector and divides that sum by the length of the vector.

| In the following question you will be asked to modify a script that will appear as soon as you move on from this question. When you have finished modifying the
| script, save your changes to the script and type submit() and the script will be evaluated. There will be some comments in the script that opens up, so be sure
| to read them!

| The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the return value of that function. We want this function to take one argument, x, and return x
| without modifying it. Delete the pound sign so that x is returned without any modification. Make sure to save your script before you type submit().

SCRIPT:
# You're about to write your first function! Just like you would assign a value 
# to a variable with the assignment operator, you assign functions in the following
# way:
#
# function_name <- function(arg1, arg2){
#	# Manipulate arguments in some way
#	# Return a value
# }
#
# The "variable name" you assign will become the name of your function. arg1 and
# arg2 represent the arguments of your function. You can manipulate the arguments
# you specify within the function. After sourcing the function, you can use the 
# function by typing:
# 
# function_name(value1, value2)
#
# Below we will create a function called boring_function. This function takes
# the argument `x` as input, and returns the value of x without modifying it.
# Delete the pound sign in front of the x to make the function work! Be sure to 
# save this script and type submit() in the console after you make your changes.

boring_function <- function(x) {
x
}
